\begin{problem}{2} ~\\
Inserts n elements starting with an empty heap is in fact isomorphic to the example of incrementing a binary counter that we learned in class. A Binomial heap can be represented by a binary number, each bit of which representing the Binomial tree $B_k$ of the heap. Linking two binomial trees with same order k together to create a tree with order k+1, which is $O(1)$, is isomorphic to 1 add 1 on a specified bit $2^{k}$. So an INSERT to the heap can be considered as an increment of the counter by 1. Since the amortized cost of incrementing a binary counter starting at 0 is $O(1)$, the amortized cost of an INSERT into an initially empty Binomial heap is $O(1)$.

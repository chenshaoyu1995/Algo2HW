(a) The number of nodes of tree $N_k$ is subject to the recurrence relation: $N_k = N_{k-1} + N_{k-2}$
($k > 1$), with initial values $N_0 = 1$ and $N_1 = 1$. This is a Fibonacci sequence. Therefore, $N_k$ can be expressed as followed:\\
\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab $N_k = \frac{\sqrt[]{5}}{5}[(\frac{1 + \sqrt[]{5}}{2})^{n+1} - (\frac{1 - \sqrt[]{5}}{2})^{n+1}]$\\
\\
(b) The height of tree $N_k$ conforms to the recurrence relation  $H_k = max(H_{k-1}, H_{k-2} + 1)$($k > 1$). \\
Since  $H_{k-1} = max(H_{k-2}, H_{k-3} + 1)$ and the height is always not less than 0, $H_k = max(H_{k-2} + 1, H_{k-2}, H_{k-3} + 1) = max(H_{k-2} + 1, H_{k-3} + 1)$. \\
Notice that $H_{k-2} = max(H_{k-3}, H_{k-4} + 1) \implies H_{k-2} \geq H_{k-3}$, $max(H_{k-2} + 1, H_{k-3} + 1)= H_{k-2} + 1 \implies H_k = H_{k-2} + 1$ for $k \geq 3$.\\
 Since $H_0 = 0$ and $H_1 = 0$, $H_2 = max(H_{1}, H_{0} + 1) = 1 = H_{0} + 1 $ and $H_3 = max(H_{2}, H_{1} + 1) = 1 = H_{1} + 1 $. So $H_k = H_{k-2} + 1$ still holds for k=2,3\\ 
$H_k = H_{k-2} + 1$($k > 1$), with initial values $H_0 = 0$ and $H_1 = 0$. $H_k$ can be expressed as followed:\\
\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab $H_k = \frac{k}{2}$, when k is even\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab $H_k = \frac{k-1}{2}$, when k is odd\\
\\
(c) Since $N_k$ is obtained by making the root of $N_{k-2}$ the leftmost child of the root of $N_{k-1}$, the degree of the root of tree $N_k$ conforms to the recurrence relation $D_k = D_{k-1} + 1$($k > 1$), with initial values $D_0 = 0$ and $D_1 = 0$. $D_k$ can be expressed as followed:\\
\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab $D_k = k - 1$, when $k > 0$\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab $D_k = 0$, when $k = 0$\\

(a) The number of nodes of tree $N_k$ is subject to the recurrence relation: $N_k = N_{k-1} + N_{k-2}$
($k > 1$), with initial values $N_0 = 1$ and $N_1 = 1$. This is a Fibonacci sequence. Therefore, $N_k$ can be expressed as followed:\\
\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab $N_k = \frac{\sqrt[]{5}}{5}[(\frac{1 + \sqrt[]{5}}{2})^{n+1} - (\frac{1 - \sqrt[]{5}}{2})^{n+1}]$\\
\\
(b) The height of tree $N_k$ conforms to the recurrence relation $H_k = H_{k-2} + 1$($k > 1$), with initial values $H_0 = 0$ and $H_1 = 0$. $H_k$ can be expressed as followed:\\
\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab $H_k = \frac{k}{2}$, when k is even\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab $H_k = \frac{k-1}{2}$, when k is odd\\
\\
(c) The degree of the root of tree $N_k$ comforms to the recurrence relation $D_k = D_{k-1} + 1$($k > 1$), with initial values $D_0 = 0$ and $D_1 = 0$. $D_k$ can be expressed as followed:\\
\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab\tab $D_k = k - 1$

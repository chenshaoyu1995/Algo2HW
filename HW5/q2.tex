\begin{problem}{2} ~\\
(a) Supposed between time slot t' and t, a Union was done. Then P(x,t) has at least one more node than P(x,t') (the root). In this case, P(x,t) $\supset$ P(x,t'). Therefore, the statement is incorrect. \\
\\
(b) Supposed between time slot t and t', a Find was done on a node that is not directly connected to the root. Between node x and the root, there is a set of nodes $N_0$. After a path compression, P(x,t') always has node x but no set $N_0$. However, P(x,t) has x, the root and $N_0$. In this case, P(x,t) $\supset$ P(x,t'). Therefore, the statement is incorrect.

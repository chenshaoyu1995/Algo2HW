(a) For two distinct items x and y in \{0,...,m-1\}, the probability that both of them are mapped to the same item in \{0,...,m-1\} by a random function is $\frac{1}{m}$. The function set satisfies the definition of universal set as given in class.\\

(b) For two distinct items x and y in \{0,...,m-1\}, the probability that they are both even or odd is $\frac{\frac{m}{2}-1}{m-1}$. This is the only situation that both selected items might be mapped to the same number. Then the probability that x and y (both even or odd) are mapped to the same item in in \{0,...,m-1\} is $\frac{1}{\frac{m}{2}}$. Overall, P(h(x) = h(y)) = $\frac{m-2}{m(m-1)}$, given that $x \neq y$, which is greater than $\frac{1}{m}$. Therefore, this function set doesn't satisfy the definition of universal set.

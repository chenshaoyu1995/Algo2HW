They are not contradictory. The fact that Vertex Cover problem can be reduced to Set Cover Problem only implies that Vertex Cover is a special case of Set Cover, and Vertex Cover can be solved not harder than Set Cover. However, the statements didn't give any reduction from Set Cover to Vertex Cover, which means Set Cover is a more general problem (probably a more complicated one) than Vertex Cover. Therefore, it's no surprise that Vertex Cover can be approximated within factor of 2 by simple algorithm, but the best hope for Set Cover is $ln n$.

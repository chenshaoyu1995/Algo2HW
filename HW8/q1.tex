\begin{problem}{1} ~\\
For an unconnected graph G(V,E), its optimal minimum cut is 0. When we calculate the approximation factor for minimization problem, we use $\frac{X_A}{X_{opt}}$. In this case, the approximation factor would be infinity. So the same randomized algorithm does not work to approximate MINCUT.

\begin{problem}{3} ~\\
According to the greedy algorithm, every time a literal was picked, at least half of the number of clauses that contain that literal would be assigned to be true. Therefore, the probability that a clause is true is at least $\frac{1}{2}$. Same as Problem 2, the approximation factor for MAXCNF-SAT is also 2.

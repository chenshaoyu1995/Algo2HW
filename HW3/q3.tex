\begin{problem}{3} ~\\
IncreaseKey(x, k)\\
while $k > FindSmallestChild(x)$ \\
\tab y = FindSmallestChild(x) \\
\tab Swap(x, y)\\
\\
FindSmallestChild(x) returns the child of x with the smallest key, which consumes $O(\log{k})$ and k is the degree of the tree whose root is x.\\
Swap(x,y) consumes $O(1)$ time.
The loop at worst would iterate $\log{n}$ times (the largest possible height of the heap)\\
Each loop would cost at worst $\log{n}$ time\\
Therefore, in the worst case, IncreaseKey costs $O((\log{n}) ^ 2)$

\begin{problem}{4} ~\\
Set Cover problem can be reduced to the Book problem. Since Set Cover is a NPC problem, the Book problem is itself a NP problem. Thus, the Book problem is also a NPC problem.\\
\\
First we prove that Book problem is a NP problem. According to the definition of NP, NP is a set of problems that are poly-time checkable. Assume that the list of language a person wants to learn is of size n, for each book, we can use $O(n)$ time to check whether it contains some languages on the lists. We remove those matches from the list. Once we've done checking k books, if there are remaining languages in the list then the Book problem is a NO. Otherwise, it's a YES. Therefore, the Book problem is a NP problem.\\
\\
The universe can be mapped to a list of language. For each item in the universe, we can treat it as the name of a language. So the universe becomes list of languages you want to learn. Then each set can be treated as a book covers several programming languages and the collection of sets becomes list of languages covered by each book. This mapping can be done in poly-time since it takes $O(|U|*|S|)$ time. After the mapping, an instance of Set Cover is converted into an instance of this problem. \\
\\
Since Set Cover is NPC, this problem is also NPC.

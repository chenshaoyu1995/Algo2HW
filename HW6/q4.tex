\begin{problem}{4} ~\\
First, we assign each edge in G a capacity of 1. Then, we can use Ford-Fulkerson to find the maximum flow (also the minimum cut) of G. Suppose the maximum flow of G is k, then k is the resilience of (G,s,t) we want to compute.\\
\\
Proof: Suppose the flow of information can be interrupted by disrupting l lines (l $<$ k). These l lines must form a cut of graph G, otherwise there is a smaller number of lines that can achieve the effect of interruption. This assumption violates the definition of minimum cut of flow networks, so it's impossible.\\
\\
Suppose the flow of information should be interrupted by disrupting L lines (L $>$ k). Then it is impossible that k is the minimum cut of graph G, otherwise L = k.\\
\\
Therefore, the algorithm described above should correctly solve the problem.
